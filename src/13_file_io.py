# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make 
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
